1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React lets us create reusable UI components. instead of writing a lot of lines of code for each individual element, a component can create multiple elements.

1. What does it mean to think in react?

Thinking in React makes you think about the apps as you build them. You can think of the data that you will be using and creating components for that data.

1. Describe state.

State is watching for a change in value for a specific piece of data. For example, if we are watching the state of a button, once that button is clicked, the value has changed and something else will appear/occur.

1. Describe props.

Props are the properties of the child element. You are unable to change the value of a prop. When passing this data down, you will need to use props.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

You use the effect hook to sync the effects. The side effect is when a function tries to modify anything outside its body.
